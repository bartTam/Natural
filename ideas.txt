Strongly typed language
Multi paradigm: OO with functional 
Compiled (to llvm)

Examples:
- Syntax
Natural => CPP

Floating string is comment ("").


polymorphism
parents
friends

object1 action object2 =>  object1.action(object2)
mesh move direction.  
mesh rotate around axis1 30 degrees. => mesh.rorate(axis1, 30)

angle between axis1 and axis2

Class definitions
- class (class name) from (parent class), (parent class)... is
    (class definition)

Constructor definition
- 
class mesh is
    this with

class vec3 is
    measure angle between this and vec3 other is
        arccos of dot product of this and other
        arccos(this dot other)

    this dot vec3 other is
        sum(this * other)

    this * vec3 other is
        

Measure angle between axis1 and axis2.
Square that.
