Natural => CPP

Floating string is comment ("").


polymorphism
parents
friends

object1 action object2 =>  object1.action(object2)
mesh move direction.
mesh rotate around axis1 30 degrees. => mesh.rorate(axis1, 30)

angle between axis1 and axis2

class mesh is
    this rotate around axis<vec3> number<float> degrees:


class vec3 is
    angle between this and other<vec3>:


Measure angle between axis1 and axis2.
Square that.
Double, round up that.
