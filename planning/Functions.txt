Functions
=======================

increment i<int> by j<int> returning int is
    i + j.


finish -> "immediately exit method"
yield  -> "the value returned from the function"

"can return iterables, or
for normal fns, save a temp
variable of what is being yielded,
and return it at the end"

implicitly: "yield then finish"


Examples
=======================

increment i<int> by j<int> is
    i + j.
	
"regular function returning output at last line"
raise base<int> to the exponent<int> is
	int output is base.
	loop for i up to exponent where
		output *= base.

""		
raise base<int> to the exponent<int> is
	product of base repeated exponent times

base<int> factorial is
	product of int from 1 to base
	
start<int> down to stop<int> is
	"body".
