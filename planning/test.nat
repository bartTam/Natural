"----------LOOPS----------"

"For Each Loop"
loop each var in [1, 2, 3, 4] where
    pass.

"While loop"
loop until (condition) where
    pass.
loop while (condition) where
    pass.
loop where true
    pass.

"Do While"
loop where
    pass.
    pass.
until (condition).

"----------FUNCTIONS----------"

increment i by j is
  i + j.

"regular function returning output at last line"
raise base(int) to the exponent(int) is
    int output is base.
    loop for i up to exponent where
        output *= base.

raise base to the exponent is
    product of base repeated exponent times.

base factorial is
    product of int from 1 to base.

start down to stop is
    pass.

"----------INITIALIZATION----------"

int p is raise 4 to the 10.

list of int points1 has pointA, 11.

"Declare of set size and uninitialized"
array of float points2 with size is 10.
array of float points3 with
    size is 10,
    initializer is 0.

graph g.
coordinate p with 10, 20.
coordinate p with
    x is 10,
    y is 20.

"----------Objects----------"

object vec3 from a is
    this is (arg0, arg1, ...)

    measure angle between this and vec3 other is
        arccos of dot product of this and other
        arccos(this dot other).

    this dot vec3 other is
        sum(this * other).

    this * vec3 other is
        (body).
