object1 action object2 =>  object1.action(object2)
mesh move direction.
mesh rotate around axis1 30 degrees. => mesh.rorate(axis1, 30)

angle between axis1 and axis2

Class definitions
- class (class name) from (parent class), (parent class)... is
    (class definition)

Constructor definition
- 
class mesh is
    this rotate around axis<vec3> number<float> degrees


class vec3 is
    measure angle between this and vec3 other is
        arccos of dot product of this and other
        arccos(this dot other)

    this dot vec3 other is
        sum(this * other)

    this * vec3 other is
        

Measure angle between axis1 and axis2.
Square that.
Double, round up that.
